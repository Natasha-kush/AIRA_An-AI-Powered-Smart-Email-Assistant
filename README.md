ðŸš€ Email Writer (Spring AI)

This project is a simple yet powerful Spring Boot application that uses Spring AI to generate professional emails based on user input. It integrates with Gemini's API and demonstrates how to build AI-powered features within Java applications. Ideal for developers exploring the intersection of AI and backend development using Spring Boot.

AIRA: An AI-Powered Smart Email Assistant is an innovative web-based application designed to automate and enhance the email writing process using prompt-based AI technology. In an era where effective communication is essential, AIRA empowers users to draft professional, well-structured, and grammatically correct emails quickly and effortlessly.

Built on a full-stack architecture, the application uses Spring Boot for the backend and React with Vite for the frontend, ensuring a fast and smooth user experience. At its core, AIRA integrates Googleâ€™s Gemini API, a powerful generative language model that enables the system to understand user input and generate human-like email content. Users simply provide a brief prompt, and the system generates a ready-to-send email.

AIRA supports multiple languages and allows users to select the tone of the emailâ€”such as formal, friendly, or persuasiveâ€”tailoring the content to the specific context or audience. Additionally, the platform includes a feature for automatic reply generation, making it highly useful in professional environments with high volumes of email communication.

One of the standout features is AIRAâ€™s browser extension, which enables users to access the assistant directly from their email platforms, providing real-time suggestions and quick email drafting without switching tabs or tools.

In summary, AIRA is a smart communication tool that merges AI with modern web development to enhance user productivity, consistency, and communication quality. It is ideal for professionals, businesses, and anyone seeking to save time and improve the effectiveness of their email interactions.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
